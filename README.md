# Todo-List
This is a todo list app I did as part of the Odin Project Curriculum. I especially enjoyed designing and building the UI, making it as minimal as possible while maintaining an intuitive user experience. You can access it here: https://zhitianguan.github.io/todo-list/


What I’ve learned:
- create more scalable and maintainable code by following SOLID principles and reducing “coupling” between objects
- CSS flexbox layout model
- localstorage to save data on the user’s computer; this way the user’s projects and tasks will not disappear upon page refresh
- JavaScript Date Object to easily sort and manage due dates
- Font Awesome for icons
